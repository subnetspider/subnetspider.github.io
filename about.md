Hello, I'm subnetspider.

My main interests involve IPv6, FreeBSD, ZFS and jails.
I also enjoy experimenting with automation (e.g. Ansible), networking, virtualisation, and lots(!) of hardware, as well as free software.
I am also interested in learning more about IT security and routing protocols, especially those used by ISPs and data centers.

This blog is dedicated to things that I want to share but which are either too long or too niche to post elsewhere online.
While I try to give good advice, I can make mistakes, so please do your own research before implementing anything I show here! :)
I only post here when I feel like it and have enough time, so posts will be irregular and spontainous.

You can best reach me via my Mastodon account on mastodon.bsd.cafe.
If you want to chat privately, send your email to <my-name>@<my-name>.com or write me on Signal via <my-name>.01.
